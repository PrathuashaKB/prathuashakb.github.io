<!-- ## About me -->
Data has the power to unlock insights, drive innovation, and shape intelligent solutions—and that’s what fuels my passion for data science and AI.

Hi, I am Prathuasha K B. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Sri Siddhartha Institute of Technology](https://ssit.edu.in/), Tumakuru, Karnataka (CGPA: 9.47 | German grade: 1.2), completed in July 2024. My academic journey led me to explore predictive modeling, data visualization, and cybersecurity, culminating in my Bachelor’s thesis, [MalDefender — A Comprehensive Malware Detection System Using
Machine Learning and Real-Time Analysis](https://ijemh.com/issue_dcp/Maldefender%20%20A%20Comprehensive%20Malware%20Detection%20System%20Using%20Machine%20Learning%20and%20Real%20Time%20Analysis.pdf), published in IJEMH under the supervision of [Dr. Renukalatha S](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=SULxxEwAAAAJ).

Beyond academics, I have gained hands-on experience through internships at DataMites (Data Science) and IBM SkillsBuild (Web Development), where I worked extensively with Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Machine Learning to develop real-world applications. With a deep curiosity for AI-driven analytics and intelligent systems, I am eager to apply my skills to global opportunities in data science, where I can contribute to cutting-edge advancements in AI and data-driven decision-making.

### Projects
**Maldefender: A Malware Detection System**  
*SSIT | MAJOR-PROJECT | October 2023–July 2024*\
\[[Paper](https://ijemh.com/issue_dcp/Maldefender%20%20A%20Comprehensive%20Malware%20Detection%20System%20Using%20Machine%20Learning%20and%20Real%20Time%20Analysis.pdf)\] \[[Code](https://github.com/PrathuashaKB/MALDEFENDER-A-Malware-Detection-System)\] \[[Presentation](https://github.com/PrathuashaKB/MALDEFENDER-A-Malware-Detection-System/blob/main/MALDEFENDERppt.pptx)\]\
Developed a malware detection system capable of identifying threats in both files and URLs using machine learning algorithms for accurate classification and prevention. This system was successfully integrated and deployed for real-time threat detection as part of my final-year major project (Bachelor Thesis) under the guidance of [Dr. Renukalatha S](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=SULxxEwAAAAJ) at Sri Siddhartha Institute of Technology, Tumakuru. MalDefender is grounded in our published research in the International Journal of Engineering, Management, and Humanities (IJEMH). The paper explores how modern machine learning techniques can enhance cybersecurity solutions, offering practical insights into proactive malware detection.\
