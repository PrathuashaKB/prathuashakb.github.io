<!-- ## About me -->
Data has the power to unlock insights, drive innovation, and shape intelligent solutions—and that’s what fuels my passion for data science and AI.

Hi, I am Prathuasha K B, a Master’s student in Data Science at [TU Dortmund University](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/en/) with a strong academic background in Computer Science and Engineering. I completed my Bachelor’s degree from [Sri Siddhartha Institute of Technology](https://ssit.edu.in/), Tumakuru, Karnataka (CGPA: 9.47 | German grade: 1.2), completed in July 2024. My academic journey led me to explore predictive modeling, data visualization, and cybersecurity, culminating in my Bachelor’s thesis, [MalDefender — A Comprehensive Malware Detection System Using Machine Learning and Real-Time Analysis](https://ijemh.com/issue_dcp/Maldefender%20%20A%20Comprehensive%20Malware%20Detection%20System%20Using%20Machine%20Learning%20and%20Real%20Time%20Analysis.pdf), published in IJEMH under the supervision of [Dr. Renukalatha S](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=SULxxEwAAAAJ).

Beyond academics, I have gained hands-on experience through internships at Rubixe - AI Solutions Company (Data Science) and IBM SkillsBuild (Web Development), where I worked extensively with Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Machine Learning to develop real-world applications. With a deep curiosity for AI-driven analytics and intelligent systems, I am eager to apply my skills to global opportunities in data science, where I can contribute to cutting-edge advancements in AI and data-driven decision-making.

### Research & Applied Interests
I am interested in **applied machine learning** and **data science** for building robust, interpretable, and data-driven systems that can operate effectively on real-world, noisy, and high-dimensional data. My focus areas include predictive modeling, analytics, causal reasoning, and explainable AI, with an emphasis on translating data into reliable insights that support decision-making. I am particularly drawn to research-driven industry work, where experimental ideas can be validated through real datasets, benchmarks, and end-to-end pipelines, and applied to domains such as cybersecurity, business analytics, and intelligent decision-support systems.
